# REMOTE CONTROL HAND GESTURES

## Scope

<font size="4">

Our goal is to control a laptop or desktop remotely using our hands – **_the left hand and the right hand_** – by connecting the **mouse** and the **keyboard** functions to an internal or external **camera**.

This kind of control is not very common in real life yet. It is still under development, and it is a research topic. That is why we chose it as our project. We want to make it possible and practical for real-life use. We also want to learn more about this technology and how to improve it and make it popular and helpful.

We are eager to learn and overcome the challenges that this technology may face because it is not well defined yet. But we are confident that we can contribute to this technology.

This technology can be useful for many purposes, such as **presentation** and **lecturing** and **personal use**. It can make controlling a laptop easier and more fun just by using our hands.

We will start by using two pretrained models that are built by Google developers.
- The first one is the **Hand landmark detection** model.
- The second one is the **Gesture recognition** model.

*_We will respect the license agreement and use these models according to the terms and conditions_*.

The way that the hand control will work is that we will use one hand as a **mode selector** and the other hand as a **mode executor**. The modes that we will provide are:
- **Mouse pointer mode**
- ...
