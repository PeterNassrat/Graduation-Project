# REMOTE CONTROL HAND GESTURES

## Introduction

- ### Overview
 
- ### Objectives

## Scope

## Requirements
- ### Functional Requirements: 
    - ### Hand Landmark Detection: 
        The system must accurately detect and track the landmarks or key points on the user's hand, such as fingertips and palm.
    - ### Tracking Consistency:

        The hand landmark detection should maintain consistent tracking, even during rapid hand movements or changes in hand orientation.
    - ### Coordinate Mapping:
        The system must map the detected hand landmarks to screen coordinates for precise control of the mouse cursor.
    - ### Mouse Movement:
        Translate the movements of detected hand landmarks into corresponding mouse movements on the screen.
    - ### Click Detection:
        Identify gestures or hand configurations representing left-click, right-click, and other click actions.
    - ### Drag and Drop:
        Implement the ability to perform drag-and-drop actions by recognizing specific hand movements.
    - ### Scrolling:
        Allow users to scroll through documents or images using hand gestures.
    - ### Tab Switching:
        The user should be able to switch between open tabs or applications on the computer using specific hand gestures.
    - ### Real-time Responsiveness:

        Ensure real-time responsiveness in updating the mouse cursor based on changes in hand landmark positions.  
    - ### Error Handling:
        Implement mechanisms to handle inaccuracies in hand landmark detection, providing feedback to the user when needed.
    - ### User Interface Feedback:
        Provide visual or auditory feedback to indicate successful hand landmark detection and corresponding mouse actions.

- ### Non-Functional Requirements: 
    - ### Performance:
        The system must respond to changes in hand landmark positions within 100 milliseconds to provide a real-time user experience and
        the system should be able to process frames at a rate of up to 30 fps
    - ### Accuracy:
        he hand landmark detection algorithm must achieve an accuracy rate of at least 95% in identifying key points on the user's hand.
    - ### Scalability:
        The system should handle hand landmark detection for various hand sizes and shapes, ensuring scalability for a diverse user population.
    - ### Usability:
        The user interface must be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily understand and control the mouse through hand gestures.s
    - ### Robustness:
        The system should operate robustly in various lighting conditions and environments without significant degradation in performance.
    - ### Security:
        Implement encryption for any communication between the system and the computer to ensure the security and privacy of user hand data.
    - ### Reliability:

        The system should maintain consistent and reliable hand landmark detection, minimizing errors and unexpected behavior.
    - ### Compatibility:

        Ensure compatibility with a wide range of computer systems, operating systems, and hardware configurations.
