## HAND REMOTE CONTROL

<font size="4">

Our goal is to control a laptop or desktop remotely using our hands – **_the left hand and the right hand_** – by connecting the **mouse** and the **keyboard** functions to an internal or external **camera**.

The way that the hand control will work is that we will use one hand as a **mode selector or action executor** and the other hand as a **mode executor**. The modes and actions that we will provide are:
- **Modes**
  - **Double click mode**
  - **Drag drop mode**
- **Actions**
  - **Scroll up**
  - **Scroll down**
  - **Zoom in** 
  - **Zoom out**
  - **Left arrow key**
  - **Right arrow key**
  - **Exit**
